<h1>UC000 "Data model with XML serialization"</h1>
<p>To check whether RMF can properly make use of ReqIF as data model and to check of the XML serialization supports all aspects supported by the metamodel</p>
<p>The following test goals are addressed</p>
<ul>
<li>All non abstract metaclasses are instantiated at least once</li>
<li>Each feature is set least once</li>
<li>Each feature is unset at least once</li>
<li>Tool extensions that are known are serialized and deserialized</li>
<li>Tool extensions that are unknown are serialized and deserialized</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
Note: it is not required that the serialized artifacts are valid with respect to the XML schema. E.g. it is allowed that mandatory elements are not serialized or that the root element is not the reqif element.

<p>For each reqif meta class a test data is defined:
<dl>
<dt>TC000_1000</dt>
<dd>ReqIF</dd>
<dt>TC000_1001</dt>
<dd>ReqIFHeader</dd>
<dt>TC000_1002</dt>
<dd>ReqIFContent</dd>
<dt>TC000_1003</dt>
<dd>ReqIFToolExtension</dd>
<dt></dt>
