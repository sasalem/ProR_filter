The reqif10.genmodel is specific to ProR and should only be used to
generate the following code.  No other code should be generated.

WARNING: Currently we have still the problem that the package name of
model and item providers differ.  Thus, after generation, there'll be
tons of errors.

WORKAROUND for now: Select all packages and hit Ctrl-O (Organize
imports)

  a. Select "Configuration"
  b. Right-Click "Generate Model Code"

2. Configuration ItemProviders

  b. Right-Click "Generate Edit Code"
